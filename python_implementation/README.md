We implement an interactive user interface in Blender as an add-on including the following functionalities:

#### define a unit smocking pattern by creating a 2D grid and drawing stitching lines
  
#### define a full smocking pattern by

– tiling the loaded unit smocking pattern (with user-defined repetition and shift of the unit pattern)

– drawing stitching lines directly on a square or hexagonal grid to define the full pattern
  
#### modify a full smocking pattern by
  
  – deforming the square grid into a radial grid (with user-defined radius)
  
  – adding marginstothepattern
  
  – combining it with another smocking pattern (along user-specified axis and space)
  
  – deleting/adding stitching lines from/to the pattern
  
#### simulate the smocked pattern with intermediate steps including
  
  – extracting the smocked graph from the pattern
